            <h2>Foreword by Scott Hahn</h2>
            <p>In this foreword, Scott Hahn sets the stage for Edward Sri's masterful work, reflecting on its origins as a Bible study from twenty years ago. Hahn praises Sri as a gifted scholar who makes complex theology accessible, like a novelist weaving a compelling narrative. Key concept: The kingdom of God is not just a promise but a reality delivered through the Church, as per Vatican II. Hahn emphasizes Jesus as Messiah-King and Emmanuel—God with us—highlighting how understanding Jesus' kingdom deepens our grasp of his identity and mission.</p>
            <p>Important theme: Continuity between promise and fulfillment. Modern example: Imagine a long-awaited sequel to a beloved book series; the foreword teases how Sri's book fulfills the anticipation, much like how the Church fulfills Jesus' kingdom promises. Illustration: Picture a tapestry where Old Testament threads weave into the New, with Jesus at the center, radiating divine light—symbolizing the kingdom's unity. This theme of fulfillment resonates in today's world, where people seek closure in personal journeys, reminding us that Jesus provides ultimate resolution in our spiritual lives.</p>
            <p>Deep understanding: Hahn underscores Sri's scholarly yet engaging style, drawing from his student days. Concept of the kingdom as both promised and delivered challenges Loisy's critique, affirming the Church as the kingdom's embodiment. Comparison: Like a CEO handing over a thriving company to trusted executives, Jesus entrusts his kingdom to the apostles, ensuring its growth. Themes of mentorship and legacy are evident, encouraging readers to see themselves as part of this ongoing story.</p>

        <section id="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction: God with Us</h2>
            <p>This introduction focuses on why Jesus lived, not just died, emphasizing his mission to establish the kingdom of God. Key concept: Jesus as Emmanuel (God with us) from Matthew 1:23, bridging the gap caused by sin since Adam and Eve. Sri explains Jesus' life as a deliberate build-up of the kingdom, stirring controversy through teachings, actions, and associations with outcasts.</p>
            <p>Important theme: Restoration of communion with God. Modern example: Think of a fractured family reunion where a mediator heals old wounds—Jesus acts as that mediator, inviting sinners back into God's family. Illustration: Envision a bridge spanning a vast chasm, with Jesus as the cornerstone, symbolizing how his kingdom reconnects humanity to divinity. Concrete comparison: In today's polarized society, Jesus' outreach to lepers and tax collectors mirrors efforts to include marginalized groups, like community programs for the homeless, showing radical inclusion.</p>
            <p>Deep understanding: Sri highlights Matthew's connections to the Old Testament, portraying Jesus as fulfilling prophecies. Concept of the kingdom as overarching mission integrates isolated events like the Sermon on the Mount or parables. Theme of controversy: Jesus' life challenges traditional piety, much like modern reformers disrupting status quo institutions. Questions for reflection encourage personal application, fostering a postgraduate-level engagement with how Christ builds his kingdom in daily life—work, family, and heart.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 1: The Return of the King (Matthew 1)</h2>
            <p>Chapter 1 delves into Matthew's genealogy, often overlooked but electrifying for first-century Jews. Key concept: Jesus as the "son of David," fulfilling the Davidic kingdom's restoration after exile. The genealogy structures generations in sets of fourteen, symbolizing completeness and hope, culminating in Jesus as the Messiah-King.</p>
            <p>Important theme: Hope amid despair. Modern example: Like tracing a family tree during a reunion to rediscover lost heritage, the genealogy reignites Jewish hope for a Davidic ruler. Illustration: Imagine a royal lineage chart glowing with golden threads leading to Jesus' name, representing divine continuity. Concrete comparison: In contemporary monarchies, a long-lost heir's return sparks national revival—similar to Jesus' arrival ending centuries of foreign rule.</p>
            <p>Deep understanding: Sri explains how the genealogy tells stories of grace through flawed figures like Tamar and Rahab. Concept of Emmanuel ties back, showing God's presence in history. Theme of covenant faithfulness: Israel's strength lay in God, not politics, echoing modern calls for spiritual integrity over power grabs. Examples: David's triumphs versus exile's lows illustrate cycles of faithfulness; today, personal "exiles" from faith find return through Jesus' kingship.</p>

Concrete comparison: Refugee stories today mirror the Holy Family's flight to Egypt, highlighting divine protection amid peril.</p>
            <p>Deep understanding: Sri notes subtle allusions assuming Old Testament familiarity. Concept of fulfillment formulas (e.g., "out of Egypt I called my son") shows Jesus embodying Israel's story. Theme of divine irony: Herod's fear contrasts God's plan, like modern tyrants failing against truth. Examples: Magi's gifts prefigure kingship and sacrifice; parallels to modern pilgrimages underscore seeking Christ amid uncertainty.</p>
